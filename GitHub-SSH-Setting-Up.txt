Step-by-Step: Install Git & Configure SSH for GitHub

Step 1: Install Git on Ubuntu

     Open your Ubuntu VM terminal:
          sudo apt update
          sudo apt install git -y
     Verify installation:
          git --version

Step 2: Set Your Git Identity

     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

Step 3: Generate an SSH Key

     ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"

When asked where to save: just press Enter (it will save to ~/.ssh/id_ed25519)

Set a passphrase or press Enter to skip

Step 4: Copy the SSH Public Key

     cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Copy the entire output (starts with ssh-ed25519...)

Step 5: Add SSH Key to Your GitHub Account

     Go to: https://github.com/settings/keys

     Click "New SSH key"

     Title: e.g., Ubuntu VM

     Paste the key into the Key field

     Click Add SSH key

Step 6: Test SSH Connection to GitHub

     ssh -T git@github.com

On first attempt, you'll see:

The authenticity of host 'github.com (IP)' can't be established...
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
Type: yes

If successful, youâ€™ll see:
Hi YourUserName! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
